# PixInsight Process Icons

The process icons that I use for RGB and SHO workflows.

Several of the icons are from [lukomatico and Bill Blanshan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFFkF6XhM), so if you use those go watch the video.

- RGB-Workflow.xpsm
- SHO-Workflow.xpsm
- FromLukeAndBill.xpsm

You can download these as a zip file, or clone (or fork) the repo
